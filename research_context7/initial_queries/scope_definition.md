# Scope Definition for context7 MCP Research

## 1. Research Goal

The primary goal of this research is to understand the "context7" Multi-Capability Provider (MCP) in depth to inform strategies for maximizing its utilization within the project's software development workflow.

## 2. Key Objectives

*   Identify and document the core capabilities, features, and functionalities of the "context7" MCP.
*   Analyze and describe how "context7" can be specifically applied to and benefit the following stages of a software development project:
    *   Technical (e.g., architecture, backend logic, infrastructure)
    *   Design (e.g., UI/UX design, prototyping)
    *   Frontend development
    *   Backend development
*   Examine any provided internal project resources for information on "context7".
*   Produce a comprehensive summary document detailing these findings.

## 3. Out of Scope

*   Implementation of "context7" integrations.
*   Comparative analysis with other MCPs (unless "context7" documentation explicitly provides such comparisons).
*   Performance benchmarking of "context7".
*   Detailed exploration of every single library "context7" might provide access to; focus will be on the MCP's mechanisms and general utility.

## 4. Deliverables

*   A structured set of research documents within the `research_context7` directory.
*   A final comprehensive summary document detailing all findings, suitable for informing workflow enhancement decisions.

## 5. Constraints

*   Individual markdown files within the research documentation should not exceed a manageable line count (approximately 200-300 lines), requiring splitting of larger conceptual documents into multiple physical files.
