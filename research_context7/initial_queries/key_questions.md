# Key Questions for context7 MCP Research

This document outlines the key questions that this research aims to answer regarding the "context7" MCP.

## 1. Core Capabilities and Functionality

*   What is the primary purpose and intended use case of the "context7" MCP?
*   What are the main tools or services provided by "context7"?
    *   What are the input parameters and expected outputs for each major tool/service?
    *   Are there any specific schemas or data formats "context7" works with?
*   What are the key features that differentiate "context7" (if any information is available)?
*   How does "context7" access or provide context? (e.g., APIs, local files, databases, specific data sources)
*   Are there any known limitations or prerequisites for using "context7"?
*   What kind of documentation or resources does "context7" provide access to (e.g., library documentation, API docs)?
*   How does the `resolve-library-id` tool work, and why is it a prerequisite for `get-library-docs`?
*   What is a "Context7-compatible library ID"?

## 2. Application in Software Development Lifecycle

### 2.1. Technical Aspects
*   How can "context7" assist in **architecture design**? (e.g., providing context on design patterns, framework capabilities, or infrastructure components)
*   Can "context7" provide information relevant to **backend logic development**? (e.g., details on specific algorithms, database interactions, API integrations)
*   Is "context7" useful for **infrastructure setup or management**? (e.g., information on cloud services, deployment tools, or configuration best practices)

### 2.2. Design Aspects
*   Can "context7" contribute to **UI/UX design**? (e.g., providing context on UI component libraries, design principles, accessibility standards)
*   How might "context7" be used during **prototyping**? (e.g., quick lookups for UI elements, API specifications for mock data)

### 2.3. Frontend Development
*   How can "context7" benefit **frontend developers**? (e.g., providing documentation for frontend frameworks/libraries, code snippets, best practices for UI implementation)
*   Can it help in resolving frontend-specific challenges (e.g., state management, component lifecycle, API consumption)?

### 2.4. Backend Development
*   How can "context7" support **backend developers**? (e.g., offering documentation for backend frameworks, database ORMs, authentication libraries, API design patterns)
*   Can it assist with backend-specific tasks (e.g., data modeling, business logic implementation, performance optimization)?

## 3. Internal Project Resources

*   What information does the file [`01_AI-RUN/Template/MCP-Context.md`](01_AI-RUN/Template/MCP-Context.md) contain regarding "context7"?
*   What details can be found in [`01_AI-RUN/Template/MCP-Server.json`](01_AI-RUN/Template/MCP-Server.json) about "context7"?
*   Do these internal resources align with, contradict, or supplement information found through external research?

## 4. General Benefits and Workflow Integration

*   What are the overall potential benefits of integrating "context7" more deeply into the project's workflow?
*   Are there specific points in the existing workflow where "context7" could be most effectively utilized?
*   What kind of information does "context7" primarily deal with? (e.g., code documentation, API specifications, general technical knowledge)
