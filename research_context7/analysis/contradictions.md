# Contradictions in context7 MCP Research

This document is intended to record any contradictions or conflicting information encountered during the research on the Upstash Context7 MCP.

As of the initial data collection and analysis phase, no direct contradictions have been identified in the information gathered from internal documents and web searches. The information from different sources appears to be largely consistent regarding the core functionality and purpose of Context7.

Potential areas where contradictions *could* arise in further, deeper research might include:

*   **"context7-legacy" vs. current version:** If the "legacy" version had significantly different features or a different underlying mechanism than the current `@upstash/context7-mcp@latest`, this could present conflicting information if not clearly delineated.
*   **Scope of "Context7-compatible libraries":** Different sources might imply varying breadths or types of libraries supported.
*   **Details of customization:** The exact capabilities and limitations of customizing a local Context7 instance might vary between different descriptions if found.

This document will be updated if any contradictions emerge.
