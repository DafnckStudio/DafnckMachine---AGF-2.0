# Knowledge Gaps in context7 MCP Research

This document identifies areas where further information or clarification is needed regarding the Upstash Context7 MCP, based on the initial data collection and analysis.

## 1. Specificity of "Context7-Compatible Library ID"

*   **Gap:** While it's understood that `resolve-library-id` provides a "Context7-compatible library ID" (e.g., 'mongodb/docs', 'vercel/nextjs'), the exact scope and nature of this compatibility are not fully detailed.
*   **Questions:**
    *   What defines a library as "Context7-compatible"? Is there a specific list or registry maintained by Upstash?
    *   How extensive is this list of compatible libraries? Does it cover a broad range of common and niche technologies?
    *   How are new libraries added or updated in this system?

## 2. Depth and Format of Retrieved Documentation

*   **Gap:** The `get-library-docs` tool fetches documentation, but the exact format, depth, and structure of this retrieved documentation are not explicitly clear. The `tokens` parameter suggests control over quantity, but not necessarily the qualitative aspects.
*   **Questions:**
    *   Is the documentation returned as raw text, structured Markdown, or another format?
    *   Does it include full API references, tutorials, code examples, or just summaries?
    *   How does the `topic` parameter influence the content retrieved? Is it keyword-based, or does it map to predefined sections of documentation?

## 3. Mechanism of "Injecting into AI Prompts"

*   **Gap:** Several sources mention Context7 "injects" documentation into AI prompts or integrates with AI coding assistants. The precise technical mechanism for this injection/integration is not detailed.
*   **Questions:**
    *   How does an MCP client (like Claude Desktop, Cursor) technically use the output of `get-library-docs` to augment an AI prompt?
    *   Is there a specific format or protocol that Context7 uses for its output that is designed for easy consumption by AI tools?

## 4. Details on Customization and Local Deployment

*   **Gap:** The mention of running a "local instance of Context7 MCP server to customize context extraction pipelines" ([`primary_findings_part2.md`](research_context7/data_collection/primary_findings_part2.md)) is intriguing but lacks detail.
*   **Questions:**
    *   What aspects of the context extraction pipeline are customizable?
    *   What technical skills or tools are required to perform such customization?
    *   How does a locally customized instance interact with the `resolve-library-id` mechanism if the library IDs are centrally managed by Upstash?

## 5. "context7-legacy" Implication

*   **Gap:** The GitHub repository `upstash/context7-legacy` ([`primary_findings_part2.md`](research_context7/data_collection/primary_findings_part2.md)) suggests that the current `@upstash/context7-mcp@latest` might be a newer version or a different iteration.
*   **Questions:**
    *   What are the differences, if any, between "context7-legacy" and the current MCP server?
    *   Is information from "context7-legacy" still fully applicable?

## 6. Practical Examples and Advanced Use Cases

*   **Gap:** While general benefits are outlined, concrete, detailed examples or advanced use-case scenarios demonstrating Context7's power in complex development situations are sparse in the initial findings.
*   **Questions:**
    *   Are there specific examples of how the `topic` and `tokens` parameters in `get-library-docs` are used to retrieve highly targeted information for a complex coding task?
    *   How would Context7 handle documentation for very large or multi-faceted libraries?

## 7. Nature of "Code Snippet Count" and "GitHub Stars" in `resolve-library-id`

*   **Gap:** The `resolve-library-id` tool uses "Code Snippet count" and "GitHub Stars" as selection criteria. The source and freshness of this metadata are unknown.
*   **Questions:**
    *   How does Context7 gather and update this metadata (snippet count, stars)?
    *   How frequently is this information refreshed to ensure relevance?

Addressing these knowledge gaps through further targeted research (if feasible within constraints) or by making informed inferences will be crucial for a comprehensive understanding and effective utilization of Context7.
