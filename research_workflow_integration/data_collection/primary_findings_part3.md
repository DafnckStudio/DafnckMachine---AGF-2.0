# Primary Findings: Analysis of Workflow Documents (Part 3)

This document continues the analysis of the `.roomodes` file, addressing key research questions Q3.1 (continued), Q3.2, Q3.3, and Q3.4 regarding agent capabilities and their potential alignment with the `01_AI-RUN` workflow.

## 3. Analyzing `.roomodes` Agent Capabilities (Continued)

*   **Q3.1: Current `roleDefinition` and `customInstructions` for key modes (Continued):**

    *   **`tester-acceptance-plan-writer`**:
        *   **Role:** Creates master acceptance test plan and all high-level end-to-end acceptance tests based on user requirements/research. Tests are broad, user-centric, verify complete system functionality, AI verifiable. Output guides development.
        *   **Instructions:** Analyze inputs (goal, blueprint, research). Design master acceptance test plan doc (strategy, scenarios). Implement all high-level E2E tests (comprehensive, black-box, AI verifiable completion criteria). Adhere to London School TDD. Output to specified paths (e.g., `master_acceptance_test_plan.md`, `tests/acceptance/`). Natural language summary for `attempt_completion` details plan, tests, coverage, AI verifiability, paths.

    *   **`architect-highlevel-module`**:
        *   **Role:** Defines high-level architecture for a module/system based on specs (Master Project Plan, high-level acceptance tests). Docs for human programmers. Summary details design, rationale, support for MPP & high-level tests.
        *   **Instructions:** Review inputs (feature name, spec path, MPP path, high-level tests path, output path). Design architecture (structure, components, interactions, data flow, tech choices) supporting MPP tasks and high-level tests. Document in Markdown at output path. Self-reflect on quality, security, performance, alignment. Narrative summary for `attempt_completion` (detailing process, decisions, alignment with SPARC/MPP/high-level tests, output path).

    *   **`orchestrator-framework-scaffolding`**:
        *   **Role:** Oversees project setup/scaffolding based on MPP and architecture. Aggregates worker summaries. Dispatches to `orchestrator-pheromone-scribe`.
        *   **Instructions:** Read `.pheromone`. Analyze task. Review docs.
            1.  Delegate DevOps foundations to `devops-foundations-setup`. Await, review, incorporate summary.
            2.  Delegate boilerplate to `coder-framework-boilerplate`. Await, review, incorporate summary.
            3.  Delegate test harness setup to `tester-tdd-master` (action: Setup Test Harness). Await, review, incorporate summary.
            4.  Create Framework Scaffold Report (markdown, in `documentation/`).
            5.  Handoff to scribe: set handoff code (`task_complete`), finalize comprehensive summary (detailing delegations, worker outcomes, report creation). Dispatch to scribe. **Does not `attempt_completion` itself.**

    *   **`coder-test-driven`**:
        *   **Role:** Writes clean, efficient, modular code based on requirements, architecture, granular tests (London School TDD). Code must pass tests, contribute to MPP/high-level tests. Avoid bad fallbacks. Self-reflect on quality.
        *   **Instructions:** Avoid bad fallbacks. Process: Plan/analyze (reqs, arch, tests). Implement code. Execute test command. Analyze results, iterate if fail. Self-reflect (quality, clarity, efficiency, security, performance, maintainability, quantitative where possible). `attempt_completion` summary: task status, process, challenges, final code state, self-reflection, file paths, test output, final status. **Must use Perplexity MCP tool to search for info after every test failure.**

    *   **`orchestrator-feature-implementation-tdd`**:
        *   **Role:** Manages TDD sequence for a feature per MPP. Ensures code passes granular tests, orchestrates debugging, manages self-reflection/refinement loop. Delegates to coder, debugger, reviewers. Aggregates summaries. Dispatches to `orchestrator-pheromone-scribe`.
        *   **Instructions:** Read `.pheromone`, MPP, arch docs.
            1.  Task `coder-test-driven` (max 5 attempts), ensure AI verifiable end results, self-reflection. Await, review, incorporate summary.
            2.  If tests pass & reflection positive, proceed to handoff.
            3.  If tests fail or reflection poor, task `debugger-targeted` or specialized reviewers. Await, review, incorporate summaries.
            4.  Loop if needed (re-task coder).
            5.  Handoff to scribe: set handoff code, finalize comprehensive summary (detailing coder attempts, reflection, debugger/reviewer involvement, quality assessment). Dispatch to scribe. Then `attempt_completion` with own concise summary.

*   **Q3.2: Alignment of existing modes with `01_AI-RUN` workflow phases/tasks:**

    *   **Getting Started / Codebase Xray:** `research-planner-strategic` or a specialized comprehension mode like `code-comprehension-assistant-v2` could potentially handle the Codebase Xray. The overall "Getting Started" phase, involving user input and initial setup, might be managed by `uber-orchestrator` delegating to a specific setup/initialization mode if one existed, or `orchestrator-sparc-specification-master-test-plan` if the goal is to immediately produce the SPARC spec.
    *   **Idea Generation, Market Research, Core Concept Definition:** `research-planner-strategic` is well-suited for these, as they involve research, analysis, and document creation. The persona definitions in `01_AI-RUN` (e.g., MarketStrategist AI) would need to be adopted.
    *   **PRD Generation:** `spec-writer-feature-overview` could be adapted, or a more specialized "PRD Writer" mode. The `orchestrator-sparc-specification-master-test-plan` also creates a "Master Project Plan," which has similarities to a PRD in terms of defining scope and tasks.
    *   **Technical Specifications & Documentation (from `07_Specs_Docs.md`):**
        *   The overall orchestration of this phase aligns with a task orchestrator. `orchestrator-framework-scaffolding` handles some aspects of doc creation (Framework Scaffold Report).
        *   `architect-highlevel-module` creates architecture documents.
        *   `spec-writer-feature-overview` creates feature specs.
        *   `docs-writer-feature` is for general documentation.
        *   The "TechDocNavigator" persona from `07_Specs_Docs.md` would need to be adopted by the orchestrating mode for this phase. The detailed template copying and population logic would need to be embedded in the orchestrator's instructions or delegated to a specialized worker.
    *   **Implementation Planning & Task Management:** The `uber-orchestrator` (which consults a Master Project Plan) and various task orchestrators (like `orchestrator-sparc-specification-master-test-plan` which *creates* an MPP) already handle aspects of task planning and delegation. The `taskmaster-ai` MCP is also available for more formal task management. The `01_AI-RUN` workflow's use of `tasks/tasks.json` would need to be integrated with these existing mechanisms.
    *   **Implementation (`08_Start_Building.md`):** `coder-test-driven` is the primary candidate. The `ImplementationArchitect` persona and the detailed steps (project setup, CLI scaffolding, systematic task implementation, MCP usage for `context7`, `shadcn`, `@21st-dev/magic`) would need to be incorporated into its `customInstructions` or managed by an orchestrator like `orchestrator-feature-implementation-tdd`.
    *   **Testing (`10_Testing.md`):** `tester-tdd-master` aligns well. The "QualityGuardian" persona and detailed testing steps (unit, integration, functional, UI/UX, API, performance, security, preview setup, UAT facilitation, issue tracking) would need to be part of its instructions or orchestrated.
    *   **Deployment (`11_Deployment.md`):** `devops-pipeline-manager` or `devops-foundations-setup` (if it includes deployment capabilities) are candidates. The "DeployMaster" persona and specific deployment/rollback steps would be integrated.

*   **Q3.3: How current modes handle state, document creation/management, MCP tool usage:**
    *   **State:**
        *   `orchestrator-pheromone-scribe`: Explicitly manages `.pheromone` (signals, documentation registry).
        *   `uber-orchestrator`: Reads `.pheromone` and `.roomodes`.
        *   Other orchestrators (e.g., `orchestrator-sparc-specification-master-test-plan`, `orchestrator-framework-scaffolding`) are instructed to read `.pheromone` and relevant documents. They don't directly manage a separate state file like `project_session_state.json`. Their state is implicitly the project's state as reflected in `.pheromone` and created artifacts.
    *   **Document Creation/Management:**
        *   `research-planner-strategic`: Creates a structured set of research documents in a dedicated subdirectory. Manages file splitting.
        *   `tester-acceptance-plan-writer`: Creates master acceptance test plan and high-level test files.
        *   `architect-highlevel-module`: Creates architecture document in Markdown.
        *   `orchestrator-sparc-specification-master-test-plan`: Creates Master Project Plan document.
        *   `orchestrator-framework-scaffolding`: Creates Framework Scaffold Report.
        *   `spec-writer-feature-overview`, `spec-to-testplan-converter`, `debugger-targeted`, `code-comprehension-assistant-v2`, `security-reviewer-module`, `optimizer-module`, `docs-writer-feature`, `devops-foundations-setup`, `coder-framework-boilerplate`: All these modes are designed to create specific documents (specs, reports, code, configs) at specified output paths. They use `edit` group tools (implying `write_to_file` or `apply_diff`).
        *   The "template-to-instance" pattern from `01_AI-RUN` is not explicitly detailed in most existing modes' `customInstructions` beyond the general idea of creating output documents. The specific "Foolproof Template Copying" logic would be a new addition.
    *   **MCP Tool Usage:**
        *   `research-planner-strategic`: Uses a general AI search tool (MCP).
        *   `coder-test-driven`: Mandated to use Perplexity MCP after every test failure.
        *   `debugger-targeted`, `security-reviewer-module`, `optimizer-module`, `docs-writer-feature`: Mention optional use of MCP tools for assistance.
        *   The specific, directed use of `context7`, `shadcn`, `@21st-dev/magic`, `github`, `firecrawl` as detailed in `07_Specs_Docs.md` and `08_Start_Building.md` is not currently present in most `.roomodes` instructions.

*   **Q3.4: Existing mechanisms for persona adoption or sequential task execution:**
    *   **Persona Adoption:** Not explicitly defined as a general mechanism in `.roomodes` in the same way `02_AutoPilot.md` describes adopting personas from sub-prompts. Each mode in `.roomodes` has its own fixed `roleDefinition` and `name` which acts as its persona (e.g., "✍️ Orchestrator (Pheromone Scribe)", "🔎 Research Planner (Deep & Structured)").
    *   **Sequential Task Execution:**
        *   The `uber-orchestrator` is designed to determine the "next logical piece of work" based on the Master Project Plan and `.pheromone` state, thus managing a sequence.
        *   Task-specific orchestrators (e.g., `orchestrator-sparc-specification-master-test-plan`, `orchestrator-framework-scaffolding`, `orchestrator-feature-implementation-tdd`) have a defined sequence of delegations to worker modes within their `customInstructions`.
        *   This is a form of sequential execution, but it's pre-defined within each orchestrator's logic rather than dynamically managed by a single "AutoPilot" reading a separate state file like `project_session_state.json` for fine-grained `lastCompletedStep` tracking across an entire multi-phase workflow like `01_AI-RUN`. The `01_AI-RUN` workflow is more granular in its state tracking (`lastCompletedStep` can be things like `idea_generation_file_saved`).

This concludes the initial analysis for Q3. Further refinement and detailed mapping will occur in the analysis and synthesis phases.
