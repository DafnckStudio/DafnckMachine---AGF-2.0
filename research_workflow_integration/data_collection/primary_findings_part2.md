# Primary Findings: Analysis of Workflow Documents (Part 2)

This document continues the primary findings, focusing on the structure and content of the `02_AI-DOCS` and `03_SPECS` directories as defined by the `01_AI-RUN` workflow, particularly [`01_AI-RUN/07_Specs_Docs.md`](01_AI-RUN/07_Specs_Docs.md:1).

## 2. Understanding `02_AI-DOCS` and `03_SPECS` Structures and Content

Based on [`01_AI-RUN/07_Specs_Docs.md`](01_AI-RUN/07_Specs_Docs.md:1) and related files:

*   **Q2.1: Purpose and structure of `02_AI-DOCS`:**
    *   `02_AI-DOCS` houses project-specific technical documentation, created from templates.
    *   Subdirectories include:
        *   `AI-Coder/`: Templates for AI coding assistance (static, not instanced per project).
        *   `Architecture/`: For `architecture.md` (from template).
        *   `BusinessLogic/`: For `business_logic.md` (from template).
        *   `Conventions/`: For `coding_conventions.md` and `design_conventions.md` (from templates), crucial for UI/UX.
        *   `Deployment/`: For `deployment_guide.md` (from template).
        *   `Documentation/`: Foundational AI guidance (e.g., `AI_Design_Agent_Optimization.md`), used as reference, not instanced.
        *   `Integrations/`: For `api_integration.md` (from template).
        *   `TaskManagement/`: Core process documents (`Roo_Task_Workflow.md`, `Tasks_JSON_Structure.md`).

*   **Q2.2: Nature of template files in `02_AI-DOCS`:**
    *   Files like `architecture_template.md` are starting structures.
    *   They provide outlines for the AI (TechDocNavigator persona) to populate with project-specific details from the PRD.
    *   Original templates **must not be modified** ([`01_AI-RUN/07_Specs_Docs.md`](01_AI-RUN/07_Specs_Docs.md:170,374,408)).

*   **Q2.3: Creation of project-specific documents from templates:**
    *   The "Foolproof Template Copying" process (detailed in [`01_AI-RUN/07_Specs_Docs.md`](01_AI-RUN/07_Specs_Docs.md:169-174,208-219,401-408,421-427) and referenced in [`01_AI-RUN/02_AutoPilot.md`](01_AI-RUN/02_AutoPilot.md:206-222)) involves:
        1.  Copying the template (e.g., `architecture_template.md`).
        2.  Renaming to the project-specific version (e.g., `architecture.md`).
        3.  Populating the new file with project-specific information.
        4.  Saving the new file.

*   **Q2.4: Role of foundational documents (e.g., `AI_Design_Agent_Optimization.md`):**
    *   These documents in `02_AI-DOCS/Documentation/` are **reference guides**, not templates for direct instantiation.
    *   The AI internalizes a "Structured Summary of UI/UX Principles" derived from them to guide the content of project-specific files like `design_conventions.md` ([`01_AI-RUN/07_Specs_Docs.md`](01_AI-RUN/07_Specs_Docs.md:34-37,227-232,419)).

*   **Q2.5: Purpose and structure of `03_SPECS`:**
    *   `03_SPECS` holds detailed project specifications.
    *   Subdirectories: `bugfixes/` (for `bugfix_spec_BUG-XXX.md`) and `features/` (for `feature_spec_FEAT-XXX.md`), both created from templates.
    *   Also houses `documentation_index.md` and potentially `codebase_xray_analysis.json` ([`01_AI-RUN/07_Specs_Docs.md`](01_AI-RUN/07_Specs_Docs.md:173,201-203)).

*   **Q2.6: Generation and use of feature/bugfix specifications:**
    *   Created in the "Technical Specifications & Documentation" phase from `feature_spec_template.md` or `bugfix_spec_template.md`.
    *   Populated with PRD details and are critical inputs for task management and implementation.
    *   Must include detailed UI/UX requirements, influenced by `design_conventions.md` and the "Structured Summary of UI/UX Principles" ([`01_AI-RUN/07_Specs_Docs.md`](01_AI-RUN/07_Specs_Docs.md:214-216,258-262)).

*   **Q2.7: Role of `03_SPECS/documentation_index.md`:**
    *   A master index of all project technical documentation.
    *   Created/updated during the "Technical Specifications & Documentation" phase.
    *   Links to newly created documents in `02_AI-DOCS` and `03_SPECS`, and foundational references.
    *   Provides a centralized reference for AI agents and human developers ([`01_AI-RUN/07_Specs_Docs.md`](01_AI-RUN/07_Specs_Docs.md:17,222-224,231,251-254,274-277,375)).

This concludes the initial findings for Q2.
