# Detailed Findings (Part 1): Analysis of `01_AI-RUN` Workflow and Document Structures

This section consolidates the detailed findings from the analysis of the `01_AI-RUN` workflow, the `02_AI-DOCS` and `03_SPECS` directory structures, and the existing `.roomodes` agent capabilities.

## 1. `01_AI-RUN` Workflow Mechanics

The `01_AI-RUN` workflow, primarily orchestrated by the logic described in [`01_AI-RUN/02_AutoPilot.md`](01_AI-RUN/02_AutoPilot.md:1), defines a comprehensive, sequential, and state-driven process for project development, from idea inception to deployment.

### 1.1. Workflow Phases

The workflow is divided into distinct logical phases, each with specific objectives, inputs, and outputs, as detailed in [`01_AI-RUN/01_Getting_Started.md`](01_AI-RUN/01_Getting_Started.md:115-165):
1.  **Getting Started:** Initialization, user input gathering, and a critical "In-Depth Codebase Understanding" (Codebase Xray) step, outputting to `03_SPECS/codebase_xray_analysis.json`.
2.  **Idea Generation:** Produces `idea_document.md`.
3.  **Market Research:** Produces `market_research.md` (or `market_research_report.md`).
4.  **Core Concept Definition:** Produces `core_concept_document.md`.
5.  **PRD Generation:** Produces `project_prd.md` by populating a copy of [`01_AI-RUN/Template/PRD_template.md`](01_AI-RUN/Template/PRD_template.md:1).
6.  **Technical Specifications & Documentation:** Involves creating multiple project-specific documents in `02_AI-DOCS/` and `03_SPECS/` from templates, guided by [`01_AI-RUN/07_Specs_Docs.md`](01_AI-RUN/07_Specs_Docs.md:1). This phase heavily emphasizes UI/UX considerations.
7.  **Implementation Planning & Task Management:** Generates `tasks/tasks.json` based on PRD and specs, following [`02_AI-DOCS/TaskManagement/Roo_Task_Workflow.md`](02_AI-DOCS/TaskManagement/Roo_Task_Workflow.md:1).
8.  **Implementation:** Code development based on tasks and specifications, guided by [`01_AI-RUN/08_Start_Building.md`](01_AI-RUN/08_Start_Building.md:1). Includes initial landing page creation and prioritized MCP usage.
9.  **Testing:** Comprehensive testing and UAT via a preview environment, guided by [`01_AI-RUN/10_Testing.md`](01_AI-RUN/10_Testing.md:1).
10. **Deployment:** Production deployment, guided by [`01_AI-RUN/11_Deployment.md`](01_AI-RUN/11_Deployment.md:1).
11. **Iteration:** Feedback collection and planning for subsequent cycles.

### 1.2. State Management (`project_session_state.json`)

As per [`01_AI-RUN/02_AutoPilot.md`](01_AI-RUN/02_AutoPilot.md:13-23,36):
*   A central JSON file, `project_session_state.json`, tracks:
    *   `currentWorkflowPhase`
    *   `lastCompletedStep` (granular step within a phase)
    *   `errorState` (structured object for errors)
    *   `pendingAction` (e.g., `user_intervention_required`)
    *   `documents` (mapping logical document names to paths and `lastValidatedHash`)
    *   `filenameMapping` (logical prompt names to actual filenames in `01_AI-RUN/`)
    *   `schemaVersion` and `warnings`.
*   This state file dictates the flow, enabling resumption and detailed error reporting.

### 1.3. Persona Adoption

[`01_AI-RUN/02_AutoPilot.md`](01_AI-RUN/02_AutoPilot.md:57-60,87-92) describes a dynamic persona adoption mechanism where the main orchestrator ("ProjectArchitect AI") adopts personas defined in sub-prompts (e.g., "MarketStrategist AI," "TechDocNavigator") for each phase.

### 1.4. Document Generation: "Foolproof Template Copying"

A core pattern, especially in the "Specs & Docs" phase ([`01_AI-RUN/07_Specs_Docs.md`](01_AI-RUN/07_Specs_Docs.md:169-224,401-428) and [`01_AI-RUN/02_AutoPilot.md`](01_AI-RUN/02_AutoPilot.md:206-222)):
1.  Identify source template (e.g., `02_AI-DOCS/Architecture/architecture_template.md`).
2.  Verify template existence.
3.  Determine target path for the project-specific instance (e.g., `02_AI-DOCS/Architecture/architecture.md`).
4.  Handle conflicts if target exists (prompt user).
5.  Copy template to target.
6.  Verify copy.
7.  Populate the new instance with project-specific information.
8.  Save and register in state.
Original templates are **never modified**.

### 1.5. MCP Tool Usage

Specific MCPs are prescribed for various tasks ([`01_AI-RUN/07_Specs_Docs.md`](01_AI-RUN/07_Specs_Docs.md:67-156), [`01_AI-RUN/08_Start_Building.md`](01_AI-RUN/08_Start_Building.md:121-148,229-260)):
*   **`context7`**: Primary for library/framework documentation.
*   **`shadcn`**: For Shadcn/UI components.
*   **`@21st-dev/magic`**: For UI component inspiration, building, and logos.
*   **`github`**: Supplementary code examples, repository operations.
*   **`firecrawl`**: Broader web research, tutorials.
*   Other MCPs implied for database and deployment.

### 1.6. User Intervention and Validation

[`01_AI-RUN/02_AutoPilot.md`](01_AI-RUN/02_AutoPilot.md:306-320) defines several points for mandatory or optional user validation (e.g., idea document approval, PRD review, template overwrite confirmation).

### 1.7. UI/UX Emphasis

A strong emphasis is placed on achieving high-quality UI/UX, guided by foundational principles (from `02_AI-DOCS/Documentation/`) that are to be synthesized into a "Structured Summary of UI/UX Principles." This summary informs the content of `design_conventions.md` and feature specifications ([`01_AI-RUN/07_Specs_Docs.md`](01_AI-RUN/07_Specs_Docs.md:34-37,214-216,227-232,258-262,326-339,399,406,425)).

## 2. `02_AI-DOCS` and `03_SPECS` Document Ecosystem

### 2.1. `02_AI-DOCS` Structure and Purpose

*   **Templates:** Contains `_template.md` files in subdirectories like `Architecture`, `Conventions`, `BusinessLogic`, `Integrations`, `Deployment`. These are copied and populated for each project.
*   **Foundational Guidance:** The `Documentation` subdirectory holds core AI guidance documents (e.g., `AI_Design_Agent_Optimization.md`, `AI_Coding_Agent_Optimization.md`, `Codebase_Xray_Prompt.md`). These are *referenced* for principles, not copied per project.
*   **Process Definitions:** `TaskManagement` contains `Roo_Task_Workflow.md` and `Tasks_JSON_Structure.md`.

### 2.2. `03_SPECS` Structure and Purpose

*   **Instance Specifications:** Contains project-specific instances created from templates, such as:
    *   `features/feature_spec_FEAT-XXX.md` (from `feature_spec_template.md`)
    *   `bugfixes/bugfix_spec_BUG-XXX.md` (from `bugfix_spec_template.md`)
*   **Key Generated Files:**
    *   `project_prd.md` (copied from template and populated)
    *   `documentation_index.md` (master index of project documentation)
    *   `codebase_xray_analysis.json` (output of initial codebase scan)
    *   Potentially other specific specs like `data_model.md`.
