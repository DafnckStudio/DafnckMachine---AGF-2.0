# Detailed Findings (Part 2): Analysis of `.roomodes` Agent Capabilities

This section continues the detailed findings, focusing on the capabilities of existing agents defined in the `.roomodes` file and their potential to execute parts of the `01_AI-RUN` workflow.

## 3. `.roomodes` Agent Capabilities

The `.roomodes` file defines various orchestrator and worker modes, each with specific roles and instructions. Key modes relevant to this integration include:

### 3.1. Orchestrator Modes

*   **`orchestrator-pheromone-scribe`**:
    *   **Role:** Exclusive manager of the `.pheromone` file (signals and documentation registry). Processes incoming natural language summaries from other orchestrators, creates new signals, updates the documentation registry, prunes old signals if `.pheromone` exceeds 400 lines, and tasks the `head-orchestrator`.
    *   **State Handling:** Manages `.pheromone` state.
    *   **Document Handling:** Updates `documentation_registry` based on summaries.
*   **`head-orchestrator`**:
    *   **Role:** Passes its entire initial prompt (overall project plan/goal) to the `uber-orchestrator`.
*   **`uber-orchestrator`**:
    *   **Role:** Reads `.pheromone` (signals and documentation registry) and the overall project plan to determine the next logical piece of work according to SPARC and the Master Project Plan (MPP). Delegates tasks to appropriate task-specific orchestrators. **Crucially, it only reads `.pheromone` and never writes to it.**
    *   **State Handling:** Reads `.pheromone` for project state.
    *   **Document Handling:** Consults `documentation_registry` and linked documents (MPP, high-level tests).
    *   **Delegation:** Selects task-specific orchestrators.
*   **`orchestrator-sparc-specification-master-test-plan`**:
    *   **Role:** Orchestrates SPARC Specification: understands user goal, defines high-level acceptance tests, creates a detailed MPP with AI-verifiable tasks. Aggregates worker summaries and hands off to the Scribe.
    *   **Document Handling:** Oversees creation of high-level acceptance tests and the MPP. Reads blueprint, research reports.
    *   **Delegation:** Tasks `research-planner-strategic` and `tester-acceptance-plan-writer`.
*   **`orchestrator-framework-scaffolding`**:
    *   **Role:** Oversees project setup/scaffolding based on MPP and architecture. Aggregates worker summaries, hands off to Scribe.
    *   **Document Handling:** Reads MPP, architecture docs. Creates Framework Scaffold Report.
    *   **Delegation:** Tasks `devops-foundations-setup`, `coder-framework-boilerplate`, `tester-tdd-master`.
*   **`orchestrator-test-specification-and-generation`**:
    *   **Role:** Orchestrates creation of granular test plan and test code for a specific feature per MPP. Aggregates worker summaries, hands off to Scribe.
    *   **Document Handling:** Reads feature spec, MPP. Oversees creation of test plan and test code.
    *   **Delegation:** Tasks `spec-to-testplan-converter`, `tester-tdd-master`.
*   **`orchestrator-feature-implementation-tdd`**:
    *   **Role:** Manages TDD sequence for a feature per MPP, including debugging and refinement. Aggregates summaries, hands off to Scribe.
    *   **Document Handling:** Reads MPP, architecture docs.
    *   **Delegation:** Tasks `coder-test-driven`, `debugger-targeted`, specialized reviewers.
*   **`orchestrator-refinement-and-maintenance`**:
    *   **Role:** Manages changes (bug fixes, enhancements, SPARC Refinement) to existing codebase. Aggregates summaries, hands off to Scribe.
    *   **Document Handling:** Reads change requests, MPP, high-level tests.
    *   **Delegation:** Tasks `code-comprehension-assistant-v2`, `tester-tdd-master`, `coder-test-driven`, `debugger-targeted`, `optimizer-module`, `security-reviewer-module`, `docs-writer-feature`.

### 3.2. Worker Modes (Relevant Examples)

*   **`research-planner-strategic`**:
    *   **Role:** Conducts deep research, organizes findings into structured documents, uses AI search (MCP). Creates a `research/` subdirectory with a defined structure.
    *   **Document Handling:** Creates many Markdown files, adheres to line limits by splitting files.
    *   **MCP Usage:** General AI search tool.
*   **`tester-acceptance-plan-writer`**:
    *   **Role:** Creates master acceptance test plan and all high-level E2E acceptance tests.
    *   **Document Handling:** Creates `master_acceptance_test_plan.md` and test files (e.g., in `tests/acceptance/`).
*   **`architect-highlevel-module`**:
    *   **Role:** Defines high-level architecture for a module/system.
    *   **Document Handling:** Creates Markdown architecture document at a specified output path.
*   **`coder-test-driven`**:
    *   **Role:** Writes code based on requirements, architecture, granular tests (London School TDD). Performs self-reflection.
    *   **MCP Usage:** Mandated to use Perplexity MCP after every test failure.
*   **`spec-writer-feature-overview`**:
    *   **Role:** Creates feature overview specification document.
    *   **Document Handling:** Creates Markdown spec at a specified output path.
*   **`spec-to-testplan-converter`**:
    *   **Role:** Creates detailed test plan for a feature, based on spec and MPP, using London School TDD and recursive testing strategy.
    *   **Document Handling:** Creates Markdown test plan at a specified output path.
*   **`devops-foundations-setup`**:
    *   **Role:** Handles foundational DevOps tasks (project directories, basic CI/CD config, Dockerfile).
    *   **Document Handling:** Creates config files, scripts.
*   **`coder-framework-boilerplate`**:
    *   **Role:** Creates boilerplate code for framework/module.
    *   **Document Handling:** Creates code files in a specified output directory.
*   **`devops-pipeline-manager`**:
    *   **Role:** Manages CI/CD pipelines, deployments, IaC operations.
    *   **Document Handling:** Creates log files.

### 3.3. General `.roomodes` Characteristics Relevant to Integration

*   **State Handling:** Primarily relies on `.pheromone` (signals and documentation registry) for inter-mode communication of state. Individual modes are generally stateless beyond their immediate task inputs.
*   **Document Creation/Management:** Many worker modes are designed to create specific output documents. The `orchestrator-pheromone-scribe` updates a central `documentation_registry`. The "template-to-instance" pattern from `01_AI-RUN` is not explicitly detailed in most current instructions.
*   **MCP Tool Usage:** Some modes have general MCP permissions or specific mandates (e.g., `coder-test-driven` with Perplexity). The highly specific, ordered MCP usage from `01_AI-RUN` (e.g., `context7` first) is not a general pattern.
*   **Persona:** Each mode has a fixed persona. Dynamic adoption is not a feature.
*   **Sequential Task Execution:** Orchestrators manage sequences of delegations to worker modes based on their `customInstructions` and input tasks. The `uber-orchestrator` drives higher-level sequences based on an MPP. This is less granular than the `lastCompletedStep` tracking in `01_AI-RUN`'s `project_session_state.json`.
*   **User Interaction:** Primarily through initial tasking and `ask_followup_question` for clarifications. Explicit, multi-step validation loops as in `01_AI-RUN` are not standard.

These findings highlight that while `.roomodes` agents have many relevant capabilities (document creation, MCP usage, orchestration), integrating the specific mechanics and granularity of the `01_AI-RUN` workflow will require targeted augmentations to their `customInstructions` and potentially new conventions for state and context management within this specific workflow.
