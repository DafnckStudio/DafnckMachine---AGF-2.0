# Discovered MCP Servers from Smithery.ai - Part 1

This document lists MCP servers discovered from `https://smithery.ai/` and provides an initial assessment of their relevance to augmenting AI agentic coding capabilities. Smithery.ai appears to be a registry and discovery platform for MCPs.

## Featured & Popular MCP Servers (Potentially Relevant for Coding):

Many servers listed here overlap with those found on Glama.ai. Key ones already noted include Context7, GitHub, various browser automation tools (Browserbase, Playwright, Puppeteer), and Sequential Thinking.

**New or Highlighted Servers of Interest from Smithery.ai:**

1.  **Desktop Commander (`@wonderwhy-er/desktop-commander`)**
    *   **Description:** Execute terminal commands and manage files with diff editing capabilities. Categories: Coding, shell and terminal, task automation.
    *   **Type:** Local.
    *   **Relevance to Coding:** Very High. Direct execution of shell commands and file manipulation are fundamental for many coding and DevOps tasks performed by an AI agent (e.g., running builds, managing project files, applying patches).
    *   **Potential Augmentation:** Could allow AI agents to perform a wider range of system-level operations and file edits.

2.  **Toolbox (`@smithery/toolbox`)**
    *   **Description:** Toolbox dynamically routes to all MCPs in the Smithery registry based on your agent's need. When an MCP requires configuration, this tool will prompt the user to configure their tool with a callback link.
    *   **Type:** Remote.
    *   **Relevance to Coding:** High. This acts as a meta-MCP or a discovery/routing layer. It could simplify how AI agents find and use other MCPs, potentially reducing the need for explicit pre-configuration of every single MCP an agent might need.
    *   **Potential Augmentation:** Could make AI agents more adaptable by allowing them to dynamically discover and use MCPs as required by a task, rather than relying on a fixed list.

3.  **Memory Management MCPs (Various)**
    *   Examples:
        *   **Memory Tool (`@mem0ai/mem0-memory-mcp`):** Store and retrieve user-specific memories.
        *   **Memory Bank (`@aakarsh-sasi/memory-bank-mcp`):** Manage AI assistant's context across sessions.
        *   **Knowledge Graph Memory Server (`@jlia0/servers`):** Local knowledge graph for user information.
        *   **Neo4j Knowledge Graph Memory (`@sylweriusz/mcp-neo4j-memory-server`):** Stores knowledge in graph format.
        *   **DuckDB Knowledge Graph Memory Server (`@IzumiSy/mcp-duckdb-memory-server`):** Memory system using DuckDB.
    *   **Relevance to Coding:** Very High. Persistent memory and contextual recall are crucial for AI agents performing complex, multi-step coding tasks. They can remember project specifics, user preferences, past errors, successful solutions, and architectural decisions.
    *   **Potential Augmentation:** Significantly improve the continuity and intelligence of AI coding agents, reducing repetitive questions and enabling more sophisticated problem-solving over time.

4.  **Command Execution Platforms & IDE Integration (Various)**
    *   Examples:
        *   **Shell Server (`mcp-shell-server`):** Execute whitelisted shell commands securely.
        *   **Windows Command Line MCP Server (`@alxspiker/Windows-Command-Line-MCP-Server`):** Interact with Windows command-line.
        *   **Code MCP (`@block/code-mcp`):** Enable AI agents to interact with VS Code (modify files, open projects, check extensions).
    *   **Relevance to Coding:** Very High. Direct interaction with the shell and the IDE (like VS Code) empowers AI agents to perform a wide range of development tasks natively.
    *   **Potential Augmentation:** Allows for more integrated and powerful AI-driven development, where the agent can directly manipulate the coding environment.

5.  **Database Interaction MCPs (Various)**
    *   Examples:
        *   **MySQL Database Access (`@dpflucas/mysql-mcp-server`)**
        *   **PostgreSQL MCP Server (`@gldc/mcp-postgres`)**
        *   **Supabase MCP Server (`@Deploya-labs/mcp-supabase`)** (Note: A Supabase MCP is already known to the project)
    *   **Relevance to Coding:** High. If the project involves database interaction, these MCPs allow AI agents to query data, inspect schemas, and potentially manage database operations.
    *   **Potential Augmentation:** AI agents could assist with database migrations, data seeding, query generation, and debugging database-related issues.

**Initial Observations:**
*   Smithery.ai lists many of the same "official" MCPs as Glama.ai, reinforcing their importance (e.g., Context7, GitHub, Browserbase).
*   The categorization on Smithery.ai (e.g., "Memory Management," "Command Execution Platforms") is helpful for identifying groups of tools relevant to specific AI agent capabilities.
*   The "Toolbox" MCP is a unique concept that warrants further investigation for simplifying MCP usage.
*   The various "Memory" MCPs are particularly interesting for enhancing the long-term context and learning capabilities of AI coding agents.
*   Direct IDE integration (e.g., `@block/code-mcp` for VS Code) and robust shell access tools are critical enablers for advanced agentic coding.

Further investigation will be needed for specific tools within these categories to understand their exact functionalities, installation methods, and how they compare to any existing tools in the project.
