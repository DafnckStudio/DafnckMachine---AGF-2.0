# Key Questions for MCP Integration and Installation Enhancement Research

This document outlines the key questions that this research aims to answer regarding the discovery, evaluation, installation, and integration of new and existing Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers.

## 1. Discovery of New MCP Servers

*   **From `https://glama.ai/mcp/servers`:**
    *   What MCP servers are listed?
    *   For each server: What are its stated capabilities, primary purpose, and typical installation method (e.g., `npx`, `uvx`, Docker)?
    *   Which of these servers appear most relevant for augmenting AI agentic *coding* capabilities (e.g., code generation, debugging, testing, documentation access, UI generation)?
*   **From `https://smithery.ai/`:**
    *   Does Smithery.ai offer or list any MCP servers directly?
    *   Are there any tools, platforms, or technologies featured on Smithery.ai that are explicitly MCP-compatible or could be easily wrapped into an MCP server?
    *   What is the primary focus of Smithery.ai, and how might its offerings relate to enhancing AI agentic coding?
*   **From `https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers`:**
    *   What MCP servers are available in this official/community GitHub organization?
    *   For each server: What are its capabilities, intended use, and installation/setup instructions?
    *   Are there any promising but perhaps less mature MCPs here that warrant consideration?

## 2. Evaluation of Discovered MCP Servers

*   For each potentially relevant MCP server identified:
    *   What specific tools or resources does it provide?
    *   What are the input schemas and expected outputs for its primary tools?
    *   How easy is it to install and configure based on available information?
    *   What are the potential benefits it could bring to the existing AI workflow (defined in `01_AI-RUN/` files)?
    *   Are there any obvious overlaps with existing MCPs in the project?
    *   What are the potential costs, dependencies, or maintenance considerations?
    *   How well does it align with the goal of "pixel perfect modern design" if it's UI/design-related?

## 3. Enhancing MCP Installation and Management

*   **Current Setup Analysis (based on [`01_AI-RUN/Template/MCP-Server.json`](../../01_AI-RUN/Template/MCP-Server.json) and existing MCP knowledge):**
    *   What are the current manual steps involved in adding and configuring a new MCP server?
    *   What are the limitations or pain points of the current approach?
*   **Automation Possibilities:**
    *   Can the installation of `npx` or `uvx` based MCPs be automated using scripts (e.g., shell scripts, Node.js scripts)?
    *   What tools or techniques could be used to manage MCP server processes (start, stop, restart, check status) more effectively? (e.g., `pm2`, Docker Compose for local instances).
    *   How can API keys and environment variables for MCPs be managed securely and efficiently within an automated setup?
*   **User-Guided Installation:**
    *   If full automation is complex or not ideal (e.g., due to varying system configurations or interactive prompts during MCP setup), what would be the clearest, most foolproof step-by-step instructions for users to install and configure MCPs?
    *   How can the project provide better feedback to the user about the status of MCP servers?

## 4. Integration Strategy for New MCPs

*   For each MCP deemed valuable:
    *   Which phase(s) of the `01_AI-RUN/` workflow would benefit most from its integration?
    *   Which AI personas (e.g., TechDocNavigator, ImplementationArchitect) should be instructed to use this MCP?
    *   What specific instructions or examples should be added to the relevant `01_AI-RUN/` prompt files to guide the AI in using the new MCP's tools?
    *   How will the successful operation or failure of these new MCP tools be handled within the automated workflow's error handling and state management?

## 5. Documentation and Workflow Updates

*   **For `01_AI-RUN/` files:**
    *   What specific changes (additions, modifications) are needed in files like `01_Getting_Started.md`, `02_AutoPilot.md`, `07_Specs_Docs.md`, `08_Start_Building.md` to:
        *   Reflect new MCP installation/management procedures?
        *   Instruct AI personas on when and how to use newly integrated MCPs?
        *   Update any pseudocode or examples involving MCP tool usage?
*   **For `02_AI-DOCS/` directory:**
    *   What new documentation files are needed (e.g., a comprehensive `MCP_Management_Guide.md`)?
    *   What updates are needed for existing documents (e.g., `AI_Coding_Agent_Optimization.md`, `Workflow_Configuration.md`) to include best practices for leveraging the full suite of available and newly integrated MCPs?
    *   What should be the content and structure of setup instructions, configuration details (including API key management), and usage examples for each key MCP?
    *   How can documentation promote "pixel perfect modern design" through the effective use of design-oriented MCPs?

Addressing these questions will form the basis for enhancing the project's MCP ecosystem and its integration into the AI-driven development workflow.
