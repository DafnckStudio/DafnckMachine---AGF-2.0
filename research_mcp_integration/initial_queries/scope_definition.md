# Scope Definition: MCP Integration and Installation Enhancement Research

## 1. Research Goal

The primary goal of this research is to identify and evaluate new Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, analyze methods for enhancing their automated/guided installation within the existing project structure, and devise strategies for their optimal integration to augment AI agentic coding capabilities. This includes outlining necessary updates to workflow prompts (`01_AI-RUN/`) and documentation (`02_AI-DOCS/`).

## 2. Key Objectives

*   **Discover New MCP Servers:**
    *   Research MCP servers available at `https://glama.ai/mcp/servers`.
    *   Investigate `https://smithery.ai/` for MCP server offerings or compatible technologies.
    *   Explore `https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers` for additional MCPs.
*   **Evaluate MCP Potential:**
    *   For each discovered MCP, document its core capabilities, features, and typical installation/configuration methods.
    *   Assess its potential to significantly augment AI agentic coding capabilities within the context of this project's existing workflow (defined in `01_AI-RUN/` files).
*   **Analyze and Enhance MCP Installation:**
    *   Review the current (template-based) approach to MCP definition in [`01_AI-RUN/Template/MCP-Server.json`](../../01_AI-RUN/Template/MCP-Server.json) and [`01_AI-RUN/Template/MCP-Context.md`](../../01_AI-RUN/Template/MCP-Context.md).
    *   Research common methods for automating or streamlining the installation of `npx` and `uvx` based tools.
    *   Propose enhancements for automated installation of MCP servers or develop clear, step-by-step instructions for user-guided installation if full automation is not optimal.
*   **Devise Integration Strategy:**
    *   For promising new MCPs, outline a strategy for their optimal integration into the project workflow.
*   **Plan Documentation Updates:**
    *   Specify content updates for `01_AI-RUN/` prompts to reflect new MCPs, their usage, and any changes to installation/runtime procedures.
    *   Outline the structure and content for new or updated documents in `02_AI-DOCS/` to provide comprehensive setup instructions, configuration details, and best practices for all relevant MCPs.

## 3. Out of Scope

*   Direct implementation of new installation scripts or modifications to the core project codebase beyond outlining changes to `.md` prompt files.
*   Full SPARC specification for new features enabled by these MCPs (this research informs that phase).
*   In-depth security audits of discovered MCPs (a general awareness of security implications is expected).

## 4. Deliverables

*   A structured set of research documents within the `research_mcp_integration/` directory.
*   A final comprehensive summary document detailing:
    *   Discovered MCPs and their evaluation.
    *   Proposed MCP installation/management enhancements.
    *   Integration strategies for new MCPs.
    *   A detailed plan for updating `01_AI-RUN/` and `02_AI-DOCS/` documentation.

## 5. Constraints

*   Individual markdown files within the research documentation should adhere to manageable line counts.
*   Focus on MCPs that directly augment AI agentic *coding* capabilities or significantly improve the developer experience within an AI-assisted workflow.
